This is a game I will design for the capstone assignment for the **MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Game Design**, an online course for game design taught by instructors from the MIT Game Lab.

A prototype for this game written in Godot is here: https://github.com/gaboma19/laundromat

### Game summary
Earlybird Laundromat is a science fiction simulation game where you play the role of a laundromat attendant on a large, habitable space station. Complete drop off service, separate dark from light clothing, fold clothes and keep the business front in clean working order. As an attendant, players can also talk to customers and learn more about the space station. The game will feature a retro pixel art aesthetic with hand drawn sci-fi characters and backgrounds.
